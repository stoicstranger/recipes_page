    <h4>The old fashioned, surely the most elevated cocktail in this brief list, bares all it has in a small but multi-faceted pour that caters to those among us who can afford the bourbon that makes it so.</h4>
    <p>To make an old-fashioned, you'll need to gather the following ingredients in a dimly lit, leatherbound room:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon sugar</li>
        <li>3 dashes Angostura bitters</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon water</li>
        <li>2 ounces bourbon (brand deliberately unspecified)</li>
        <li>Garnish: orange peel</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The steps are as follows:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Add sugar and bitters to a glass</li>
        <li>Add water and stir until sugar is nearly dissolved</li>
        <li>Fill with ice and add bourbon, stirring gently</li>
        <li>Squeeze the oil of the orange peel over the glass and place peel into glass</li>
        <li>Put your turtle neck on if it wasn't already, start the jazz, and pray your friend recommended the right bourbon</li>
    </ol>

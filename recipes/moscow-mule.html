    <h4>The most refreshing drink in a copper cup, a moscow mule is about as simple as it gets, and yet manages to be extremely polarizing because...well, ginger beer+lime juice+mint. Somehow, it works.</h4>
    <p></p>
    <p>To make a moscow mule, you'll need the following ingredients and the IQ of a literal mule:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>2+ ounces of vodka (everyone uses Tito's but you do you)
        </li>
        <li>1/2 ounce lime juice, make it fresh</li>
        <li>6 ounces of ginger beer</li>
        <li>Garnish: mint leaf</li>
        <li>A real copper mug, if you're a rich snob</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    <p>The steps are as follows:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix the ingredients together</li>
        <li>Add ice</li>
        <li>Drink, I guess? Do you really need steps for this?</li>
    </ol>
